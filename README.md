# ChoroplethMap

This map shows the percentage of adults with a college education in each county of the United States. Counties are color coded, based on these data. The user can see more information --- county name, state, and exact percentage --- by hovering over a county on the map. 

I completed this project using D3.js, json, and topojson. I compared county codes in both data sets, in order to correctly assign data to the map.

Areas of improvement: 
1.) Tooltip styling would enhance the user experience.
2.) Changing the if/else statements into switch statements (improves readability).
3.) Use a filter() function instead of a for loop (improves readability).
